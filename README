Take emails from an mail/usenet account, split and decode attachments and get plain text version of the message body into a big sexy array.

TODO: Improve this document

Stick this file in the controller/components folder, and add it to the $components on the relavent controller for Cake 1.3 or alternative for Cake 2.0.


Usage example:
        $this->Processmail->server = '{imap.gmail.com:993/imap/ssl/novalidate-cert}';
        $this->Processmail->login = 'username@gmail.com';
        $this->Processmail->password = 'password123';
	$this->Processmail->deleteAfterRetr = true;
        $messages = $this->Processmail->getMessages();

The server needs to be in the format of php's imap_open() function, and can handle POP,IMAP,NNTP and Unix Mail Spool

If messages are not being deleted from the mailbox, an optional variable can be passed to speed up large mailboxes:
	$this->Processmail->optimise = true;

This will only pull undeleted messages since yesterday.
