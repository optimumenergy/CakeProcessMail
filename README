TODO: Improve this document

Stick this file in the controller/components folder, and add it to the $components on the relavent controller.


Usage example:
        $this->Processmail->server = '{imap.gmail.com:993/imap/ssl/novalidate-cert}';
        $this->Processmail->login = 'username@gmail.com';
        $this->Processmail->password = 'password123';
        $messages = $this->Processmail->getMessages();

The server needs to be in the format of php's imap_open() function, and can handle POP,IMAP,NNTP and Unix Mail Spool
